  <h1>Hi!This is Parlero.</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into pink</h2>
  <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into sky blue</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
    the background color of the word "paragraph" to yellow, and its text color  to black, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>First, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result!<p/>
    <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">100</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">500</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "sumanswer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
  
    <p>Second, I am going to subtract the following two numbers and display the result!<p/>
    <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">100</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">500</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the difference of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "diffanswer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="diffButton" value="Click to Subtract!">

   <p>Third, I am going to multiply the following two numbers and display the result!<p/>
    <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">100</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">500</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the product of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "proanswer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="productButton" value="Click to Multiply!">
